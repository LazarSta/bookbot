# Bookbot by Lazar S

Bookbot is the first project I have tackled upon learning Python, terminals and Git!


-- **Disclosure** --

This is a guided project by Boot.dev



-- **Description** --

Build your first local command-line application in Python and use the real tools that developers use every day.
You'll build a real command-line application in Python that does static analysis on text files, or rather, entire novels like "Frankenstein". You'll be guided through the set up of a professional development environment using VS Code, Git, and Github. This is the perfect first Python project for beginners.
